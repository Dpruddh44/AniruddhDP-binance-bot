# Binance Futures Trading Bot

This is a professional, command-line interface (CLI) trading bot for the Binance USDT-M Futures Testnet. Developed as a technical assignment for a Python developer role, this project showcases clean code, secure practices, and a creative, user-friendly interface.

## Features

  * **Creative & Professional CLI**: Utilizes `rich` and `pyfiglet` to provide a visually engaging interface with banners, spinners, and beautifully formatted tables for output.
  * **Multiple Order Types**: Full support for **Market** and **Limit** orders, plus an implementation of advanced **OCO (One-Cancels-the-Other)** orders.
  * **Secure API Key Handling**: Loads API credentials securely from a local `.env` file, which is ignored by Git via `.gitignore` to prevent secret exposure.
  * **Robust Command Parsing**: Uses Python's `argparse` library for a professional CLI experience, including automatic help messages (`-h`) and argument validation.
  * **Comprehensive Logging**: All actions, API responses, and errors are logged to a `bot.log` file, providing a complete audit trail of the bot's activity.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

  * Python 3.8+
  * A Binance Futures Testnet account

### 1\. Clone the Repository

Clone this project to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-name>
```

### 2\. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*(Note: You will need to create a `requirements.txt` file by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` in your terminal)*

### 3\. Configure API Credentials

Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project. This file will hold your API keys and will not be tracked by Git.

```
# In .env
BINANCE_API_KEY="YOUR_TESTNET_API_KEY"
BINANCE_API_SECRET="YOUR_TESTNET_SECRET_KEY"
```

-----

## Usage

All commands must be run from the project's root directory.

### Market Orders

Places an order that executes immediately at the best current price.

```bash
# Format: python src/market_orders.py <SYMBOL> <SIDE> <QUANTITY>
python src/market_orders.py BTCUSDT BUY 0.001
```

### Limit Orders

Places an order that executes only when the market reaches a specified price.

```bash
# Format: python src/limit_orders.py <SYMBOL> <SIDE> <QUANTITY> <PRICE>
python src/limit_orders.py ETHUSDT SELL 0.05 3500
```

### OCO (One-Cancels-the-Other) Orders

For an existing open position, this places both a take-profit and a stop-loss order. If one is triggered, the other is automatically canceled.

```bash
# Format: python src/advanced/oco_orders.py <SYMBOL> <SIDE_OF_POSITION> <QUANTITY> <TAKE_PROFIT_PRICE> <STOP_LOSS_PRICE>
python src/advanced/oco_orders.py BTCUSDT BUY 0.01 65000 58000
```
